# WORKPLACE ROOM BOOKING API PROJECT

A simple room booking API built with Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and PostgreSQL.

## SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

### Run in Docker 

#### Step 1: Build and start containers

In terminal run
```
docker-compose up --build
```

Wait for the database and API to fully start.

#### Step 2: Seed the Database (OPTIONAL-You can populate users, teams, rooms tables yourself too)

Open a new terminal tab and run :

```
docker exec -it room-booking-api node src/seed.js
```

This will populate the users, teams, rooms tables

#### Step 3: Test the API

visit http://localhost:3000

## ASSUMPTIONS 


##### 1. Max Conference Room Capacity = 6

##### 2. User can be a part of only one team

##### 3. Booking(every endpoint) works on daily basis on hourly slots (i.e. You can't book or get availablity for future days & you cant book in between hours like 10:30-11:30)

##### 4. Children headcount/age is necessary only in the cases of conference room bookings
